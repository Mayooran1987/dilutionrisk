\title{Comparison based on probability of detection curves for different dilution schemes when the diluted samples collected from a heterogeneous batch.}
\usage{
pd_curves_heterogeneous(mu_low, mu_high, sd, a, b, f, u, USL, n_sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu_low}{the lower value of the mean concentration (\eqn{\mu}) for use in the graphical display's x-axis (on the log scale).}

\item{mu_high}{the upper value of the mean concentration (\eqn{\mu}) for use in the graphical display's x-axis (on the log scale).}

\item{sd}{the standard deviation of the normal distribution (on the log scale).}

\item{a}{lower domain of the number of cell counts.}

\item{b}{upper domain of the number of cell counts.}

\item{f}{final dilution factor.}

\item{u}{amount put on the plate.}

\item{USL}{upper specification limit.}

\item{n_sim}{number of simulations (large simulations provide more precise estimations).}
}
