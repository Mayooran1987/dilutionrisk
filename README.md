# ‘dilutionrisk’

The ‘dilutionrisk’ package aims to develop Monte-Carlo estimates of probabilities and graphical displays in the study associated with modelling and assessment of risk based on aerobic plate count (APC) on diluted testing. Also, a description of this package’s functions is available at <https://mayooran1987.github.io/dilutionrisk/reference/index.html>.
