\title{Probability of detection estimation for multiple dilution schemes when diluted samples are collected from a heterogeneous batch.}
\usage{
prob_detection_heterogeneous_multiple(mu, sd, a, b, f, u, USL, type , n_sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{the mean microbial count (on the log scale).}

\item{sd}{the standard deviation of the normal distribution (on the log scale).}

\item{a}{lower domain of the number of cell counts.}

\item{b}{upper domain of the number of cell counts.}

\item{f}{vector of final dilution factor.}

\item{u}{vector of amount put on the plate.}

\item{USL}{upper specification limit.}

\item{type}{what type of the results you would like to consider such as "theory" or "simulation" (default "theory").}

\item{n_sim}{number of simulations (large simulations provide a more precise estimation).}

Probability of detection when samples collected from a heterogeneous batch.

\description{
\code{\link{prob_detection_heterogeneous_multiple}} provides a probability of detection for multiple dilution schemes in the original sample when samples collected from a heterogeneous batch.
}
\details{
\code{\link{prob_detection_heterogeneous_multiple}} provides a probability of detection when diluted samples are collected from a heterogeneous batch. We define the random variable \eqn{X_{i}} is the number of colonies on the \eqn{i^{th}} plate.
In practice, the acceptance for countable numbers of colonies on a plate must be between 30 and 300. Therefore, we can utilise bounded distributions to model the number of colonies on a plate. In the heterogeneous case, we employed truncated Poisson lognormal distribution to the model. (this section will be updated later on).
